# Pepys' Travels

> "But Lord! to see the absurd nature of Englishmen, that cannot forbear laughing and jeering at everything that looks strange." — *Samuel Pepys*

## Overview

The aim of this project is using AI to plot out the travels of Samuel Pepys. By analyzing his famous diary, we extract locations, dates, and events to visualize his journeys through 17th-century London and beyond.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**.
2.  **Run the preprocessing script**:
    ```bash
    ./preprocess_diary.sh
    ```
    This will download the data, parse it, check for consistency, and generate statistics.
3. TODO: Use AI to parse Trips in entries.

## Requirements
* Just plain python, no dependencies.
